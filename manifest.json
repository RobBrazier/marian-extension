  "post": "As I clean up books and editions, I often find myself scrolling deep into Amazon pages to get details. To reduce RSI, I'm working on a Chrome Extension that will pull the most Hardcover-relevant data, making it easier to click-to-copy fields for pasting in Hardcover. Clicking the image will download a full-res copy to your PC with the ISBN number as its filename. It currently works on book or Audible pages on amazon.com. I can add functionality for GR / TSG if others would find this useful."
